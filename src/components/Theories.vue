                    <p>This is the biggest theory of all and some people argue the British knew and said nothing because they wanted America in the war.They were being battered constantly
                        by German planes during the Blitz. They needed America's help to win the war.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Did the American government know and not tell anybody?</p>
                    <p>This theory isa little less known and is about if the government knew about the attack but didn't tell anyone because the economy needed a boost and a war would
                    certainly create more jobs and get the economy running again. There is no proof to it but in the movie Pearl Harbor, you can see an admiral
                    holding a telegram that says attack by Japan imminent which came an hour after the attack.</p>
