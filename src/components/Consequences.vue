                    <p>The largest direct consequence of the pearl harbor attack was that America joined the war and fought in europe
                    against the Germans and the Italians and in the Pacific againt the Japanese. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto was against attacking the
                        Americans from the beginning and was reported to have said after the attack "I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and
                      fill him with a terrible resolve.</p>
                    <p>The next direct consequence was the failure to hit American aircraft carriers. Since they were not at Pearl Harbor during the surprise attack,
                the Americans mangaged to get one 200 miles of the coast of Tokyo, Japan and bomb it in return. Then the next big Japanese attack failed because
                the american aircraft carriers were able to plan and defend against the next attack and surprise the Japanese at the battle of Midway. This battle
                was the turning point for the war of the Pacific and Japan's downfall.</p>
                    <p>The largest indirect consequence of the attack was the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
                    These attacks by the Americans forced Japan's surrender.</p>
