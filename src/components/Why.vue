                    <p>There are many events that led to this attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese.
                      I will explain the most important ones.</p>
                    <p>World War 2 had already started when the attack happened. The blitz had finished a few months before in may 1941.
                    The Japanese had also signed the tripartite act with the Germans and Italians which was a defensive pact that was directed at
                    America. America had put oil and economic sanctions on Japan which enraged the Japanese further.</p>
                    <p>The attack was planned to cripple America's ability to stop Japanese expansion in asia. America was neutral at the time.</p>
                    <p>The attack was a planned surprise attack and was successful as one. The Japanese attacked on the 7th of december 1941
                    at 7:48 am Hawaiian Time. Service men and their families were either still in bed or at church because it was a sunday.</p>
