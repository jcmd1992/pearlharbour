The vue web application is about pearl harbour. I changed the style a bit and it can talk to the server-side application from assignment one. The web app can create a message and save it in the database which is mongo atlas which was created in assignment 1 which means it has persistence. The messages are displayed back on the client side from the database and can be filtered by messageid, usersid and messages. Message can be deleted on the client side and removed from the database. Messages cannot be saved if they donâ€™t meet the requirements of the form.


The database schema is messages.
